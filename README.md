# Tail Control and DAQ Software

MATLAB scripts, C++ program, and Arduino sketch to find and implement piscoform servo positions along the biomometic emulator's tail.

Note: The C++ serial port manipulation code is a modified version of the code written by Manash Kumar Mandal that can be found at https://blog.manash.me/serial-communication-with-an-arduino-using-c-on-windows-d08710186498. Thanks Manash!

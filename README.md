# Tail Control and DAQ Software

MATLAB scripts, C++ program, and Arduino sketch to find and implement piscoform servo positions along the biomometic emulator's tail.

Note: The C++ serial port manipulation code is a modified version of the code written by Manash Kumar Mandal that can be found at https://blog.manash.me/serial-communication-with-an-arduino-using-c-on-windows-d08710186498. Thanks Manash!

Note: The MATLAB code uses an intersection finding function that can be found at https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/11837-fast-and-robust-curve-intersections and was written by Douglas Schwarz. Thanks Doug!
